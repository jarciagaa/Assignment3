                <p>Gojo is not the type of person to lie. If he states something and has 100% confidence, it is for a good reason. Never doubt the goat.</p>

                <p>He always had faith that the MC, Yuji Itadori, and his nakamas will surpass him. For that to happen, he has to pass something to them in order for them to receive such a power boost. If Gojo can't stop Sukuna, I don't believe anyone else can.</p>
